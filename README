LibGL Core Functions extension wrangler
=======================================

NOTE: This is more an experiment, to see what we can do.
      Some of the stuff is not finished, or is not done at the nicest
      way. Mainly since that's all dependent on how exactly this wrangler
      is used, and which else libraries are used together with it.

LibGL Core Extension Wrangler (GLCEW) is a cross-platform open-source
C/C++ extension loading wrangler. It allows to avoid application to be
linked against libGL libraries by doing runtime open of dynamic libraries.
This allows to have software which can gracefully handle situations when
OpenGL libraries are not nstalled on the system. The usecases of this are:

- Software which can either run in headed and headless mode. Using this
  wrangler allows to run software on compute farms of all sorts.

- Detect which XCB or other GUI protocol to use. It might be Wayland or even
  something more obscure.

There are two levels of wrangling:

- Functions which are considered safe to be a function pointers, are
  read as function pointers. This includes such functions as GLX's
  glXGetProcAddressARB().

- OpenGL Core functions are not really safe to be such function pointers,
  so for them this wrangler has a stub/wrapper implementation, which
  mimics original function declaration, and passes calls to a symbol
  which was dynamically load.
